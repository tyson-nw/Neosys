## This is the test environment for the Codename: Neosys (Actual Name Pending) Basic Alpha .02 SRD

Our goal is to create an SRD that supports a game that is sightly less complext than D&amp;D but still feels familar. We are aiming for a game with more complexity than your average Indy title. It should include modern affordances that OSR games tend to eschew. If you are interested in seeing a game that fits into that sweet spot view and comment the current form of the the ruleset, please comment on the [Working Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17lTn_lGhdV852Dl1cnE2N9I6CH7k-PraQphxsXD_6e8/edit?usp=sharing).
